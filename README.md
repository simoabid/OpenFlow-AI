**OpenFlow-AI** is a proactive, on-device AI agent for Android that autonomously understands natural language commands and operates your phone's UI to achieve them. Inspired by the need to make modern technology more accessible, OpenFlow-AI acts as your personal operator, capable of handling complex, multi-step tasks across different applications.

## Core Capabilities

* 🧠 **Intelligent UI Automation:** OpenFlow-AI sees the screen, understands the context of UI elements, and performs actions like tapping, swiping, and typing to navigate apps and complete tasks.
* 📢 **High Qaulity voice:** OpenFlow-AI have high quality voice by GCS's Chirp  
* 💾 **Persistent & Personalized local Memory:** ⚠️ **Temporarily Disabled** - OpenFlow-AI memory is turned off as of yet. Memory functionality will be restored in a future update.

## Architecture Overview

OpenFlow-AI is built on a sophisticated multi-agent system written entirely in Kotlin. This architecture separates responsibilities, allowing for more complex and reliable reasoning.

* **Eyes & Hands (The Actuator):** The **Android Accessibility Service** serves as the agent's physical connection to the device, providing the low-level ability to read the screen element hierarchy and programmatically perform touch gestures.
* **The Brain (The LLM):** All high-level reasoning, planning, and analysis are powered by **LLM** models. This is where decisions are made.
* **The Agent:**
    * **Operator:** This is executor with Notepad.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Android Studio (latest version recommended)
* An Android device or emulator with API level 26+
* Some Gemini keys, sample ENV
```python
# the name of these keys donot mean you need google cloud, you can use any servers that can accept requests, i will improve the developer experience in the future by making openapi compatible
GCLOUD_PROXY_URL=<url-of-any-backend-that-accept-responses-like-below-payload>
GCLOUD_PROXY_URL_KEY=<any-password-you-wanna-set-or-leave-empty>
```
`payload`
```
{
  "modelName": "model-name",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "parts": [
        {
          "text": "Hello, what can you do?"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "role": "model",
      "parts": [
        {
          "text": "I can help you with a variety of tasks. What do you need assistance with today?"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
or
```
//you can also add gemini keys to play around

```




### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/simoabid/OpenFlow-AI.git](https://github.com/simoabid/OpenFlow-AI.git)
    cd OpenFlow-AI
    ```

2.  **Build & Run:**
    * Open the project in Android Studio.
    * Let Gradle sync all the dependencies.
    * Run the app on your selected device or emulator.

3.  **Enable Accessibility Service:**
    * On the first run, the app will prompt you to grant Accessibility permission.
    * Click "Grant Access" and enable the "OpenFlow-AI" service in your phone's settings. This is required for the agent to see and control the screen.

## 🗺️ What's Next for OpenFlow-AI (Roadmap)

OpenFlow-AI is currently a powerful proof-of-concept, and the roadmap is focused on making it a truly indispensable assistant.
